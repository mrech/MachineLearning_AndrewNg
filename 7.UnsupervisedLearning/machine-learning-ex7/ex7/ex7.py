## ================= Part 1: Find Closest Centroids ====================
#  To help you implement K-Means, we have divided the learning algorithm 
#  into two functions -- findClosestCentroids and computeCentroids. In this
#  part, you should complete the code in the findClosestCentroids function. 

print('Finding closest centroids.\n\n')

# Load an example dataset that we will be using
data = loadmat('ex7data2.mat')
X =  data['X']

# Select an initial set of centroids
K = 3 # 3 Centroids
initial_centroids = np.array([[3, 3], [6, 2], [8, 5]])

# Find the closest centroids for the examples using the
# initial_centroids
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, initial_centroids)

print('Closest centroids for the first 3 examples: \n')
print((idx[:3, :]+1))
print('\n(the closest centroids should be 1, 3, 2 respectively)\n')

input('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n')

## ===================== Part 2: Compute Means =========================
#  After implementing the closest centroids function, you should now
#  complete the computeCentroids function.

print('\nComputing centroids means.\n\n')

# Compute means based on the closest centroids found in the previous part.

centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K)

print('Centroids computed after initial finding of closest centroids: \n')
print(centroids)
print('\n(the centroids should be\n')
print('   [ 2.428301 3.157924 ]\n')
print('   [ 5.813503 2.633656 ]\n')
print('   [ 7.119387 3.616684 ]\n\n')

input('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n')

## =================== Part 3: K-Means Clustering ======================
#  After you have completed the two functions computeCentroids and
#  findClosestCentroids, you have all the necessary pieces to run the
#  kMeans algorithm. In this part, you will run the K-Means algorithm on
#  the example dataset we have provided. 

print('\nRunning K-Means clustering on example dataset.\n\n')

# Settings for running K-Means
max_iters = 10

# For consistency, here we set centroids to specific values
# but in practice you want to generate them automatically, such as by
# settings them to be random examples (as can be seen in
# kMeansInitCentroids).

# Run K-Means algorithm. The 'true' at the end tells our function to plot
# the progress of K-Means
centroids, idx = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters, True)

print('\nK-Means Done.\n\n')

input('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n')

%% ============= Part 4: K-Means Clustering on Pixels ===============
%  In this exercise, you will use K-Means to compress an image. To do this,
%  you will first run K-Means on the colors of the pixels in the image and
%  then you will map each pixel onto its closest centroid.
%  
%  You should now complete the code in kMeansInitCentroids.m
%

fprintf('\nRunning K-Means clustering on pixels from an image.\n\n');

%  Load an image of a bird
A = double(imread('bird_small.png'));

% If imread does not work for you, you can try instead
%   load ('bird_small.mat');

A = A / 255; % Divide by 255 so that all values are in the range 0 - 1

% Size of the image
img_size = size(A);

% Reshape the image into an Nx3 matrix where N = number of pixels.
% Each row will contain the Red, Green and Blue pixel values
% This gives us our dataset matrix X that we will use K-Means on.
X = reshape(A, img_size(1) * img_size(2), 3);

% Run your K-Means algorithm on this data
% You should try different values of K and max_iters here
K = 16; 
max_iters = 10;

% When using K-Means, it is important the initialize the centroids
% randomly. 
% You should complete the code in kMeansInitCentroids.m before proceeding
initial_centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K);

% Run K-Means
[centroids, idx] = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ================= Part 5: Image Compression ======================
%  In this part of the exercise, you will use the clusters of K-Means to
%  compress an image. To do this, we first find the closest clusters for
%  each example. After that, we 

fprintf('\nApplying K-Means to compress an image.\n\n');

% Find closest cluster members
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids);

% Essentially, now we have represented the image X as in terms of the
% indices in idx. 

% We can now recover the image from the indices (idx) by mapping each pixel
% (specified by its index in idx) to the centroid value
X_recovered = centroids(idx,:);

% Reshape the recovered image into proper dimensions
X_recovered = reshape(X_recovered, img_size(1), img_size(2), 3);

% Display the original image 
subplot(1, 2, 1);
imagesc(A); 
title('Original');

% Display compressed image side by side
subplot(1, 2, 2);
imagesc(X_recovered)
title(sprintf('Compressed, with %d colors.', K));
